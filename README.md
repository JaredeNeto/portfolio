## About

Backend engineer with 14+ years of experience building and modernizing large-scale distributed systems — most recently at Itaú Unibanco, Latin America's largest financial institution, serving tens of millions of active users.

My work has focused on **platform-level engineering**: shared services layers, observability stacks, SRE practices, and architectural standards adopted across multiple squads. I've operated in high-stakes environments where reliability isn't optional.

This portfolio contains public, standalone projects that reflect the kind of work I've done in production — now visible.

## Projects

### 🔧 [platform-core](https://github.com/jaredeneto/platform-core)
> Shared services layer simulating a real platform engineering context: API gateway, JWT auth with scope-based access control, inter-service contracts, and distributed tracing.

**Demonstrates:** modular architecture · Zod contracts as single source of truth · JWT middleware as higher-order function · OpenTelemetry with vendor-neutral OTel Collector · integration tests with Fastify inject · multi-stage Docker build  
**Stack:** Node.js · TypeScript · Fastify · Zod · OpenTelemetry · Docker  
**Structure:** built incrementally across 3 branches — foundation → contracts & auth → observability

### ⚙️ [async-worker-go](https://github.com/jaredeneto/async-worker-go) `Coming soon`
> Async message processing worker in Go with concurrency control, circuit breaker, graceful shutdown, and Prometheus metrics.

**Stack:** Go · RabbitMQ · Prometheus · Docker

---

### 📋 [slo-as-code](https://github.com/jaredeneto/slo-as-code) `Coming soon`
> SLO definitions, alert rules as code, and structured runbooks — SRE practices made explicit and version-controlled.

**Stack:** Terraform · Datadog · Prometheus rules · Markdown runbooks
